A resource need not have a digital representation, and the representation of a resource may also be a distinct resource in it’s own right. There is a whole gamut of issues about resources, possibly the best known is httpRange-14. 

A lot of these questions only become important when you start getting involved with Semantic Web technology. For example, is this properly described as a web page or as a blog post?

I use Google Reader, Google Search, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google Mail, Google Play, Google Chrome and Blogger. I use these things because Google is becoming the Unix of the web - a large set of simple, single-purpose tools that play nicely together.

So it’s only natural that I also want to use Google+ too. It would be so very convenient.

There are two problems. First off, I’ve become too us</p></a></li>
