the pros and cons of the x86 processor. It’s not all bad.

It is impressive that software written for the 8086, which was released 35 years
ago, will still run without modification on the latest Intel i7 or AMD A-series.
But it’s also a burden, because as anyone who has ever tried to manipulate the
Global Descriptor Table will tell you, holding on to back-compatibility has
led to some hideously fragmented data structu</p></a></li>

			
				

<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/09/operating-system-development//mobile.html"><h3>Operating System Development</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">12 September 2012</time><p>To amuse myself while I wait for the new term to start in a few weeks time, I’ve
turned to a very old firend - osdev.

When I was a teenager I dabbled in Operatng Systems quite a lot. I had some 
great vision of how a new operating system should be, but of course I lacked
both the patience and the knowledge to actually bring it about.

I’m somewhat older and wiser now, so maybe I’ll get a little further than 
printing “hello world”. At the moment, I’m just trying out some ideas in a very
simple </p></a></li>

			
				

<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/06/javascript-alternatives//mobile.html"><h3>Javascript Alternatives</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">11 June 2012</time><p>Over the last four weeks I’ve been rather busy with exams, but now that’s over I’m thinking computer again.

I’ve been looking at some of the alternatives to JavaScript. In many ways JavaScript is a lovely little language, it’s incredibly flexible. But, the same dynamic type system that makes it so flexible also makes certain things very difficult (like writing or consuming modular APIs), and the prototype-based object system obscures many of the benefits of object-oriented programm</p></a></li>

			
				

<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/03/ajax-and-file-uris//mobile.html"><h3>Ajax and file&#58;// URIs</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">28 March 2012</time><p>Ajax is becoming the dominant method, if it isn’t already, of getting data in and out of a web application. But Ajax is built on top of XMLHttpRequest, which as the name suggests is only really well defined if the underlying protocol is HTTP.

So what about local files? The new Filesystem API’s are coming, but they sandbox us heavily. At least for the time being, if we want to muck about with self-modifying code or local file-based data sources we have to hack it, which means using </p></a></li>

			
				

<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/03/whatever-happened-to-osid//mobile.html"><h3>Whatever Happened To Osid</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">22 March 2012</time><p>Five years ago, or so, we had a wonderful suite of open, abstract API’s developed by a group led out of MIT and calling themselves the Open Knowledge Initiative. These API’s were the Open Service Interface Definitions, and although they had a definite flavour of Java about them, the specs were deliberately designed to be platform neutral.

OKI now appears to be defunct, but a lot of what they produced is still sitting there on SourceForge.

Now a lot of this was usel</p></a></li>
