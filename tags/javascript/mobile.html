I just hacked it together now to implement the new theme I’m writing for this blog.

I’m using quite a few icons in the new theme and I wanted to embed them as data: URIs. The trouble is, I’m using the same icon in several places which means duplication, and having great blocks of base64 embedded in the code is making it al</p></a></li>

			
				

<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/06/javascript-alternatives//mobile.html"><h3>Javascript Alternatives</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">11 June 2012</time><p>Over the last four weeks I’ve been rather busy with exams, but now that’s over I’m thinking computer again.

I’ve been looking at some of the alternatives to JavaScript. In many ways JavaScript is a lovely little language, it’s incredibly flexible. But, the same dynamic type system that makes it so flexible also makes certain things very difficult (like writing or consuming modular APIs), and the prototype-based object system obscures many of the benefits of object-oriented programm</p></a></li>

			
				

<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/03/initialising-web-workers//mobile.html"><h3>Initialising Web Workers</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">28 March 2012</time><p>I've had tonsillitis over the last 5 days or so, so I've spent most of the last few days in a bit of a daze, idly tinkering with random things to pass the time. As with much idle tinkering, it's all a bit rough and ready, but here is one snippet which might prove useful.

I was tinkering with Web Workers and I wanted to be able to load up Require.js in a worker and then pass it the name of a main module. So I wrote this stub, lets call it w.js, which goes in the same directory as re</p></a></li>

			
				

<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/03/ajax-and-file-uris//mobile.html"><h3>Ajax and file&#58;// URIs</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">28 March 2012</time><p>Ajax is becoming the dominant method, if it isn’t already, of getting data in and out of a web application. But Ajax is built on top of XMLHttpRequest, which as the name suggests is only really well defined if the underlying protocol is HTTP.

So what about local files? The new Filesystem API’s are coming, but they sandbox us heavily. At least for the time being, if we want to muck about with self-modifying code or local file-based data sources we have to hack it, which means using </p></a></li>

These API’s were the Open Service Interface Definitions, and although they had a definite flavour of Java about them, the specs were deliberately designed to be platform neutral.

OKI now appears to be defunct, but a lot of what they produced is still sitting there on SourceForge.

Now a lot of this was usel</p></a></li>
