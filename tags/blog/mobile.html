<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/08/multiple-representations//mobile.html"><h3>Multiple Representations</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">31 August 2012</time><p>Well, I now have an arrangement which provides multiple views of the pages of 
this website. Believe me, that was difficult to achieve.

I’d investigated quite a few different Jekyll plugins, and when I couldn’t find
one to do what I wanted I investigated quite a few different approaches to
writing Jekyll plugins. But then I realised, I can do what I need far more
simply.

I’ve been thinking about the relationship between resources and their
representations. I wrote recently about the difference</p></a></li>

			
				

<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/08/static-site-generators//mobile.html"><h3>Static Site Generators</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">26 August 2012</time><p>I’m using Jekyll to maintain this site. I first started doing so because it was convenient
to serve from Github pages, but now I run Jekyll locally in order to support customisation
and plugins which I can’t have if I run it on Github.

Jekyll itself is fine. There are a few things which niggle at me, but that would be true
for anything. The joy of using open source software is that you can modify and adapt your
way around anything that you don’t like.

There is an a</p></a></li>

			
				

<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/07/the-new-setup//mobile.html"><h3>About This New Setup</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">16 July 2012</time><p>So, this new setup is more or less as I want it. I somewhat prematurely put it live on 
Github pages on Saturday, even though I’m continuing to tinker with it.

I started off using Jekyll-Bootstrap. This was a massive
timesaver. I’ve used Liquid before, so the Jekyll learning curve was very easy for me, but 
if you haven’t then I recommend Jekyll-Bootstrap as a way of easing the transition. The 
templates and includes that Jade has in there are fairly adaptable, and you can learn

<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/07/the-new-edition//mobile.html"><h3>The New Edition</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">14 July 2012</time><p>The long-awaited redo of this blog is at hand.

After a brief bout of insanity brought on by spending too much time with Blogger’s excuse 
for a template system, I realised: I don’t need all that complexity. Browsing around for 
something with which to replace Blogger, and preferably not add too much to the vast
number of accounts I’m dragging around with me, I stumbled onto Jekyll. And so, here we
are.

Now, it’s been some time since I last sunk my teeth into a new </p></a></li>

			
				

<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/06/views-dynamic-and-otherwise//mobile.html"><h3>Views, dynamic and otherwise</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">14 June 2012</time><p>I’ve changed theme on this blog. I was using Dynamic Views, and now I’m using a generic Awesome Inc. theme.

I love the way Dynamic Views looks. It’s very sleek, but it’s impossible to adapt. After a dozen attempts I gave up getting Alex Gorbatchev’s SyntaxHighlighter to work with it, and a brief experiment with altering the CSS ended very badly indeed - it looked like a clown.

So to solve the first of those two problems I have switched to an old-style theme tempora</p></a></li>
