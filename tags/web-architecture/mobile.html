A resource need not have a digital representation, and the representation of a resource may also be a distinct resource in it’s own right. There is a whole gamut of issues about resources, possibly the best known is httpRange-14. 

A lot of these questions only become important when you start getting involved with Semantic Web technology. For example, is this properly described as a web page or as a blog post?

<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/08/static-site-generators//mobile.html"><h3>Static Site Generators</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">26 August 2012</time><p>I’m using Jekyll to maintain this site. I first started doing so because it was convenient
to serve from Github pages, but now I run Jekyll locally in order to support customisation
and plugins which I can’t have if I run it on Github.

Jekyll itself is fine. There are a few things which niggle at me, but that would be true
for anything. The joy of using open source software is that you can modify and adapt your
way around anything that you don’t like.

There is an a</p></a></li>

for use in Man-in-the-Middle traffic interception. TrustWave were redeemed somewhat by
having already revoked the offending certificate before voluntarily disclosing what they
had done.

For most users, security hinges on SSL/TLS to provide an encrypted connection, and X.509
PKI to provide certificates all the way up to a small number of trusted roots. A large
number will be aware of the term</p></a></li>

			
				

<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/05/social-networking//mobile.html"><h3>Social Networking</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">18 May 2012</time><p>I like Google+. There’s a very good reason for this: integration.

I use Google Reader, Google Search, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google Mail, Google Play, Google Chrome and Blogger. I use these things because Google is becoming the Unix of the web - a large set of simple, single-purpose tools that play nicely together.

So it’s only natural that I also want to use Google+ too. It would be so very convenient.

There are two problems. First off, I’ve become too us</p></a></li>

			
				

<li data-theme="f"><a href="/2012/05/wheres-my-data//mobile.html"><h3>Where's my Data!</h3><time class="ui-li-aside">15 May 2012</time><p>I have Facebook. I have Google+, Google Docs, Google Play, GMail, Blogger, Picasa and various other Google products. I have a Live@edu email account. I have a github account, a SourceForge account, a cloud9 account, and a Hojoki account. I have an account with Ocado and another with Tesco, and one with Amazon. I have at least two OpenIDs, and a dozen more services which I routinely use by federated logon to one of the above.

I have accounts with online services that I don’t even re</p></a></li>
