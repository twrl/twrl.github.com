It's been a week and a half since the government launched the Equal Marriage Consultation, which means it's been about twelve hours less than that since I responded and about a decade longer than that since it became a pressing social question.

I'm bored with it already. The consultation period goes on until some time in mid June. Why do we need a twelve week consultation for something which the government has (a) already asked every official body which has an opinion about, and (b) the government has already decided to do and told everybody as much repeatedly?

I suspect it's a diversionary tactic. It keeps people like the bishops from looking too closely at the budget, and even if they do any unfortunate revelations about how it will have adverse effects on charities or people on lower incomes won't be reported because some <del>old fool</del> bishop or <del>drooling troglodyte</del> tabloid journalist is far to busy getting over excited about "the gays want to marry, next thing they'll want us to decriminalise sex!" or some such nonsense. It's like fox hunting all over again - Tony Blair managed to drag that out for years, and whenever it looked like a political crisis was looming there'd be another debate on the Hunting Act.

However, in the spirit of the debate, here are the key points for me: in our culture, marriage is considered to be a recognition of a long term romantic relationship, and it has specific cultural connotations about fidelity, interdependence and so on. Religious, as opposed to civil, marriage has further religious connotations. Civil partnerships, being a relatively new innovation, have much the same practical legal effect but much less of the cultural baggage.

Now since we're recognising that there are a wide range of possible relationship styles and structures, none of which are intrinsically more or less valid than any other, it follows that there needs to be different styles of recognition to match. In addition to the legalisation of same-sex civil marriage, it's therefore necessary to legalise mixed-sex civil partnerships and same-sex religious marriage.

As far as religious marriage goes, I think it's important not to confuse legalising something with mandating it - a distinction which many religious leaders, along with totalitarian dictators, seem not to grasp. Requiring religious groups to do something would have unpleasant religious freedom implications, but equally prohibiting them from doing something has many of the same problems.

Anyway, by giving all couples all three options, we give them the freedom to have their relationship recognised in the most appropriate way to them. Unrealistic expectations are a killer for relationships, even expectations of third parties, and branding a relationship as a "marriage" when those involved are much more comfortable with the label and connotation of a civil partnership is not going to help matters.
