The long-awaited redo of this blog is at hand.

After a brief bout of insanity brought on by spending too much time with Blogger's excuse 
for a template system, I realised: I don't need all that complexity. Browsing around for 
something with which to replace Blogger, and preferably not add too much to the vast
number of accounts I'm dragging around with me, I stumbled onto Jekyll. And so, here we
are.

Now, it's been some time since I last sunk my teeth into a new language, and learning Ruby
has been on my to-do list for a while. So not only am I using Jekyll to maintain my blog, 
I'm progressively tampering with it in an effort to learn Ruby.
