			<h1>Microdata vs RDFa</h1>
		</div>
		<div data-role="content">

			<p>To my shame, I&rsquo;ve largely ignored the development of microdata until very recently. I&rsquo;ve 
been aware of it going on in the background, but I&rsquo;ve been far more concerned with RDFa
and JSON-LD when it comes to semantics.</p>

<p>Google told me that they were favouring microdata for semantic markup, so I looked
into it. At first, I was rather taken by it&rsquo;s simplicity. There is much less mucking about
with CURIEs and namespaces than in RDFa.</p>

<p>Once the novelty wore off however, I started to see the cracks. Microdata is designed very
much to be accessible to designers. RDFa is a more complicated embedding of RDF into HTML,
which means it can encode more complex parts of the graph more succinctly. It also 
lacks many of the ambiguities that microdata can introduce around dereferencing terms.</p>

<p>Which is not to say that microdata is without it&rsquo;s merits - far from it. Microdata is
a simpler embedding of RDF into HTML, which means it can encode simpler parts of the RDF
graph more succinctly than RDFa can. It&rsquo;s more human-writable, and somewhat simpler to 
parse. </p>

<p>Both are equally as expressive.</p>

<p>The new RDFa 1.1 recommendation has absorbed a lot of lessons both from it&rsquo;s predecessor,
and from the development of microdata. RDFa began life as one module in the XHTML2 
development effort, and now stands apart from the development of HTML and XHTML as a 
separate-but-related entity. So there is plenty of room to revise and update RDFa as
technologies and practices change.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to stick with RDFa. The reason is simple - I don&rsquo;t want to simply annotate a
few properties here and there, I want to converge semantic, structural and presentational
data. RDFa, which more closely reflects the underlying RDF graph, meshes more easily for
me with other ways of expressing RDF - like RDF/XML and JSON-LD.</p>
