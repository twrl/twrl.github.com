			<p>For the last several months I&rsquo;ve been trying to move away from iTunes as my media library.
Alas, this is a pipe dream, because I have made the mistake in the past of buying movies 
and TV shows through the iTunes store.</p>

<p>Several years ago, Apple abandoned their ironically named FairPlay DRM software for music
and music videos, however it it still used for movies and TV shows bought through the 
iTunes store. This presents a quandary, because from Apple&rsquo;s point of view they have sold 
me a copyright license to this content, and by doing so through the iTunes store have 
taken steps to ensure I can benefit from this license. However, from my point of view I 
have been sold a good, or at a pinch a service, which has not been consistently rendered -
I am unable to consume media which I have legitimately paid for in the manner that I would
wish.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure that somewhere in the terms of use of the iTunes store that I clicked
through without reading, I agreed to use iTunes in perpetuity for all my media viewing 
needs, and thus it&rsquo;s my own fault. There is probably some clever legalese in there which
gets around this kind of vendor lock-in being illegal in most jurisdictions of the world
too.</p>

<p>The fact is that Apple have taken my money and failed to provide in exchange the media for
which it was given in a format acceptable to me. I&rsquo;m sure no actual liability would attach
to Apple for this; legally they should be able to afford to cover their own backsides 
adequately, and anyway they are beholden to the studios and others who license this 
content to them for distribution.</p>

<p>The immediate lesson for people is: <strong>DO NOT BUY STUFF FROM THE iTunes STORE</strong>, but I&rsquo;m
sure that&rsquo;s obvious. It does however point to a whole slew of issues to do with the
inadequacies of how we deal with digital content.</p>

<p>The trouble is that when we purchase some digital content, whether it&rsquo;s music or a video 
or a game or anything else, it exists in a sort of limbo. From the point of view of the 
vendor, it&rsquo;s inevitably seen as a copyright license to be defended. From the point of 
view of the consumer, it&rsquo;s seen as a good to be used.</p>

<p>If I were a corporation, I could license come intellectual property under contract and be 
held to that contract. However, in the normal course of things I would not expect hourly 
audits, monitoring of my day to day activities, cryptographic measures to prevent me 
viewing the licensed property, or punitive enforcement measures. That we do expect these 
things suggests that we are far outside the scope of normal copyright license agreements. </p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s stop pretending that digital goods are the same as copyright licenses, and equally
let&rsquo;s not pretend that they&rsquo;re the same as something you might pick off a shelf. We have
to admit that digital artefacts are a unique species of thing, and that attempts to 
control them under the old systems are failing. As it stands, there is a strengthening
argument for the total abolition of copyright, and that argument is predicated on the 
excesses of copyright law used to protect digital property. </p>

<p>There are four major forms of intellectual property rights: copyright, patents, trade
marks, and trade secrets. Each of these, in principle, serves a purpose as sound now as
when Queen Anne enacted the very first copyright statute 300 years ago. When somebody
creates something of worth, in exchange for sharing it with society they gain a temporary
monopoly on making any profit from it.</p>

<p>And in exchange for buying something, a consumer should gain the right to enjoy it at
their leisure.</p>

<p>Now, one can argue that copyrights on the order of a century or more are not what anyone
originally had in mind. Perhaps more importantly, one can argue that nobody intended for 
it to become illegal to know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_prime">certain integers</a>.
But it&rsquo;s difficult to believe that licensees were supposed to be limited in their
enjoyment of the content that they license. Gutenberg could have made a fortune if he 
had been able to charge extra for the right to read his bibles on Tuesday, or with brown
eyes instead of blue.</p>

<p>Equally, ownership of a good does not limit what you do with it because you cannot 
duplicate it at negligible cost like you can with computer data. I can&rsquo;t press a button 
and turn one hammer into two, and my friends can&rsquo;t take a look at my hammer and 
automatically gain one of their own. There is a reason why the sale of goods is an 
inadequate model for the sale of digital artefacts, just as copyright licensing is.</p>

<p>For digital goods copyright laws are not equitable to consumers, and sale of goods laws
are not equitable to vendors. But for too long now copyright vendors have been benefiting
from the excesses that the prevailing copyright model allows them, and it&rsquo;s beginning to
crumble. Unless a new model can be found for digital content, then we can expect copyright
to become hateful and worthless in spite of it&rsquo;s merits.</p>
