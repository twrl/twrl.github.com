			<h1>Static Site Generators</h1>
		</div>
		<div data-role="content">

			<p>I&rsquo;m using Jekyll to maintain this site. I first started doing so because it was convenient
to serve from Github pages, but now I run Jekyll locally in order to support customisation
and plugins which I can&rsquo;t have if I run it on Github.</p>

<p>Jekyll itself is fine. There are a few things which niggle at me, but that would be true
for anything. The joy of using open source software is that you can modify and adapt your
way around anything that you don&rsquo;t like.</p>

<p>There is an argument that <a href="http://www.jeremyscheff.com/2011/08/jekyll-and-other-static-site-generators-are-currently-harmful-to-the-free-open-source-software-movement/">static site generators are harmful</a> to FOSS. The 
reasoning is that we expect a certain level of dynamic and interactive content - 
commenting, sharing, and so forth - and by using a static generator to maintain a website 
we&rsquo;re also tying ourselves in to third parties and their proprietary infrastructures. For
example, if you scroll down this page, you&rsquo;ll see a Disqus comments box at the bottom.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly care about that though. I don&rsquo;t share <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">RMS&rsquo; aversion to SaaS</a>. But I do care about the functionality that I can build on top of the
platform that I&rsquo;m using.</p>

<p>Jekyll limits me somewhat because it&rsquo;s written in Ruby, which I don&rsquo;t know very well 
(having only started learning it recently) and don&rsquo;t especially like (no curly brackets).
I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll get used to it, but for the time being I can&rsquo;t easily knock something
together and play with it. I&rsquo;m still at the stage where making quite simple tweaks is a
fairly involved process with lots of to-ing and fro-ing with language guides and API docs.
I may or may not stick with Jekyll in the long run.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve definitely seen the light when it comes to static site generators. Static content
is easy to host and easy to serve. Yes, I would like to integrate my own dynamic elements
too, but that&rsquo;s a fair way down my list of priorities. What I want is to be able to take 
my data, and churn out a website. And although there&rsquo;s functionality which I can&rsquo;t
implement with Jekyll, that&rsquo;s as much down to my limitations as Jekyll&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>As client side development has become more and more powerful, the need for server-side
dynamics has diminished. We&rsquo;ve reached a point where only a very small number of services
have to be on a server, and most of those are some kind of database endpoint or security
system. I don&rsquo;t actually need PHP or Node or ASP.Net to generate my pages if I want to host
my own comments - I can do the presentation work on the client - I just need a RESTful 
JSON store with some basic anti-spamming logic.</p>

<p>Somewhat circuitously, this brings me back to data portability and distributed social
networking. If I can have my RESTful data buckets, I can take responsibility for exposing
their content (or not). I can set aside a bucket or two for the dynamic elements of my
website. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what Jekyll has shown me - I don&rsquo;t need to be dynamic on the server.</p>
