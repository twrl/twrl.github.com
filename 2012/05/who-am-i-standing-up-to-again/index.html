            <div property="articleBody" class="cf layout-cell-l3 content">
                <p>There was an article today on the Huffington Post by Max Wind-Cowie called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/max-windcowie/gay-marriage-who-will-stand-up-to-the-hetero-phobes_b_1514024.html?ref=uk-politics">Who Will Stand Up to the Hetero-Phobes?</a>&rdquo; - and it&rsquo;s really got me seething. So much that I feel I have to rebut it. Here goes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A little while ago I wrote a piece for ConservativeHome about how the attacks and smears of the pro gay marriage campaign had shaken my belief in the cause to its foundations. The impulse to cry &lsquo;paedo&rsquo; every time a Catholic spoke of their discomfort over same sex marriage, the howls of &lsquo;bigot&rsquo; accompanying even the most gentle warning about potential implications - these are the characteristics of a movement that no longer believes it can win an argument and has instead decided to rely on ad hominem and vitriol. It is intolerant and it is ugly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are three things here - first of all if your belief in a cause is so shaken by the actions of said cause&rsquo;s supporters, that&rsquo;s deeply concerning. Your belief was presumably not terribly strong, or <em>tu quoque</em> would not be an issue. I don&rsquo;t have to like what Israel gets up to in the middle east to oppose anti-semitism.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually seen cries of &lsquo;paedo&rsquo; every time a Catholic speaks of sex, same-sex marriage, or the Roman church&rsquo;s dogma regarding the subject - perhaps I&rsquo;m looking in the wrong places. I have seen the pedophile priest debacle used to put pay to Catholic figures attempting to take the moral high ground on sexual ethics, especially when making &ldquo;won&rsquo;t somebody please think of the children&rdquo; style arguments. While I&rsquo;ll grant this is a rather crude tactic, it&rsquo;s not a wholly inappropriate response to Catholic bishops claiming to be in a position of inviolable moral authority, in contrast to the evil homosexual agenda to turn everyone&rsquo;s children.</p>

<p>And then there is the term bigot. I&rsquo;m surprised that this needs explaining, but a bigot is by definition a prejudiced and intolerant person. So when somebody provides an objection to same-sex marriage which is not born of prejudice and intolerance, but instead comes from a balanced and rational appreciation of the relevant facts, then I shall refrain from calling them a bigot. When somebody provides an objection which is born of ignorance, stupidity, or centuries of institutionalised hatred and scapegoating, then I shall call them a bigot with impunity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the last week we have seen further examples of the extent to which the gay rights militia has abandoned any moral authority and now seeks, apparently unashamedly, not to win through debate but to rob others of their right to speak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is clearly misleading. To start with, the validity of the argument for same-sex marriage is not challenged by what Wind-Cowie perceives as heterophobia. I don&rsquo;t feel I have some great &lsquo;moral authority&rsquo; to abandon - the LGBT movement is fighting for it&rsquo;s rights, not for some moral ideal - we&rsquo;re more like Mandelas than Ghandis. Neither is what follows a detriment to others&rsquo; right to free speec, or it wouldn&rsquo;t be if it had been reported accurately:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First came the Advertising Standards Authority&rsquo;s demand that the blogger &lsquo;Archbishop Cranmer&rsquo; answer for the adverts he had run on behalf of the Coalition for Marriage campaign. These ads - which showed heterosexual couples celebrating their nuptials and implored viewers to sign the coalition&rsquo;s petition - apparently caused &lsquo;hurt and offence&rsquo; to some gay people. The only way in which one could possibly be &lsquo;hurt&rsquo; by the ad would be if one were somehow offended by the image of straight couples doing what straight couples have done for thousands of years - marrying one another. This isn&rsquo;t a reaction against &lsquo;hate speech&rsquo; folks, it&rsquo;s outright hetero-phobia.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>These readers responded to their &lsquo;hurt&rsquo; not by engaging in debate or navigating away from the page but by submitting complaints to the ASA - who have followed up in aggressive style and have frightened the man behind the avatar into hiring in the lawyers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the ASA, <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/05/16/asa-responds-to-claim-it-persecuted-religious-blog-in-investigating-anti-gay-marriage-ad/">the relevant complaints refer to the advert itself</a> and in particular the (potentially) misleading 70% statistic from the ComRes/Catholic Voices poll. It is the advert which is under investigation, not the blogger who was contacted as part of said investigation. This appears to be the witness/suspect distinction gone awry.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Next came the extraordinary decision by the Law Society to withdraw permission for an event on the role of heterosexual marriage in a good and just society. Cristina Odone (who was due to speak at the event alongside my friend Phillip Blond) has written for the Telegraph that the decision was taken on the basis that a discussion of heterosexual marriage contravened the esteemed society&rsquo;s &lsquo;diversity policy&rsquo;. Apparently diversity - for the Law Society at least - stretches only one way in the discussion of public policy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The event in question was a colloquium held by the <a href="http://www.worldcongress.org/">World Congress of Families</a>, a religiously motivated, US-led, conservative organisation whose stated principles include such gems as &ldquo;Marriage between a man and a woman forms the sole moral context for natural sexual union. Whether through pornography, promiscuity, incest or homosexuality, deviations from these created sexual norms cannot truly satisfy the human spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sincerely doubt that what they had in mind was a balanced debate - apparently the Law Society agrees, although they have not to my knowledge publicly commented. Would it be appropriate for the Law Society to host a well-rounded debate on a contentious issue of public policy: eminently. Would it be appropriate for the Law Society to host a group of people, most if not all of whom are already in broad agreement, ranting at each other about how LGBT people are seeking to undermine society: absolutely not.</p>

<p>The rights of Christina Odone and others to free expression are not compromised by the Law Society refusing to be their soapbox. One person&rsquo;s right to free speech does not give somebody else an obligation to be their platform.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And this is the problem. I too believe in diversity. I&rsquo;m a gay man (who, as it happens, believes that gay marriage is the right way forward for our society) who has benefited from our tradition of allowing a plurality of views and for the open discussion of what is good and right and what is bad and wrong. Were it not for Britain&rsquo;s tolerance of dissent who would have been brave, or foolish, enough to argue that people like me ought not be imprisoned for our sexual desires?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On this at least we are in agreement. However, I see the matter of diversity, equality and fairness rather differently - perhaps more pessimistically.</p>

<p>It is a sad truth that in our society people can&rsquo;t simply expect to be treated fairly, instead we must have and use the law to enforce &lsquo;fairness&rsquo;. As a society we have determined that who you love is a characteristic that leads to people being treated unfairly, and is worthy of being so protected. We have not determined that who you hate is a characteristic worthy of the same consideration.</p>

<p>But people&rsquo;s fundamental rights continue unabridged. Refusing to indulge anti-gay groups publicity stunts, or asking awkward questions of fundamentalist bloggers, is not comparable with the criminalisation of homosexuality. Sixty years ago both Wind-Cowie and myself would either have been imprisoned or chemically castrated - that Christina Odone had to air her views on the website of the Telegraph instead of the floor of the Law Society is minutiae by comparison. Last week, as happens alarmingly often the world over, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/11/jay-corey-jones-gay-minnesota-teen-suicide_n_1510001.html">it was widely reported that a teenager committed suicide after a campaign of homophobic bullying</a> - not an event which is analogous to a badly worded letter from the ASA bruising somebody&rsquo;s feelings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet that very word, &lsquo;diversity&rsquo;, has now come to represent not plurality but homogeneity, not dissent but repression. Hiding behind it, secularists and the ayatollahs of social liberalism are able to strip public discourse of the bits they don&rsquo;t like - faith, orthodoxy, skepticism about change. They have been able to use the frame of diversity as a weapon against its very purpose; to shut out and shut up those with whom they disagree.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It&rsquo;s time for those gay men and women who genuinely prize freedom to take a stand against those who act against it in our name. It is up to us to continue winning the argument for the freedoms our society permits us - not to preserve those freedoms at the expense of others&rsquo; consciences or right to speak. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Faith has no place in the machinery of state. If the law must reflect the Catholic religious view that I should not marry, why should it not reflect the hardline Islamic view that I deserve to be stoned to death? Or the pastafarian view that everybody eat spaghetti and meatballs once a week? Regardless of my personal views on religion, it has no place in the state - otherwise where do you draw the line. The price of religious freedom is freedom from religion.</p>

<p>The argument for same-sex marriage is already won.</p>

<p>The fight now is social - it&rsquo;s holding teachers accountable for the fact that homophobia is not just &lsquo;playground banter&rsquo;, it pointing out the demeaning and devaluing implications of &ldquo;love the sinner, hate the sin&rdquo;, and so on. If that&rsquo;s what people wish to believe or profess then so be it, but their right to believe these things and profess these things does not prevent me from arguing with them, nor from shaming them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If my society gives me the right to marry I want that right to have sprung from a collective judgment, not from the authoritarian zeal of those acting, supposedly, on my behalf. Let&rsquo;s leave the hetero-phobia at the door and get on with the business of political and moral debate. For goodness sake gays, stop whinging about people who disagree with you - argue with them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The collective judgement seems to agree with us right now, but anyone foolish enough to believe that the will of the majority can guarantee peoples rights has an alarmingly short memory. If collective judgement were the only force for change, maybe we would be imprisoned after all.</p>

<p>This whole style of thought, putting principle before practice; think tanks, rhetorical style and Westminster politics before suicide rates, homophobic crime and homelessness; this moral high ground, the concept that we must protect the freedom of the people who hate us; this is the biggest challenge which we now face in advancing the cause of LGBT equality - it&rsquo;s within ourselves.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s our instinct: be normal, take the moral high ground, articulate your complaints, reason with the unreasonable, conform, integrate, assimilate, play the game. This is how we earn our place at the table: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gay but he&rsquo;s a nice chap,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she pretty, she used to be a man don&rsquo;tchaknow.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not a table I want to sit at - we can carve out other places in society.</p>

<p>Equality before the law is but a stones throw away - an equal place in society is shaping up to be a much longer and more bitter fight, and greatest opponents may yet prove to be each other.</p>
