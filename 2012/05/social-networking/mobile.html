			<p>I like Google+. There&rsquo;s a very good reason for this: integration.</p>

<p>I use Google Reader, Google Search, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google Mail, Google Play, Google Chrome and Blogger. I use these things because Google is becoming the Unix of the web - a large set of simple, single-purpose tools that play nicely together.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s only natural that I also want to use Google+ too. It would be so very convenient.</p>

<p>There are two problems. First off, I&rsquo;ve become too used to clicking &ldquo;Log on with Facebook&rdquo;. For a lot of services that I use, I&rsquo;ve never actually created an account. This is not an insurmountable problem, I&rsquo;ll live with more passwords in my life.</p>

<p>The second is more substantial: I have around 350 Facebook friends. I have six friends who use Google+.   The update streams, photos, and so on I can work around or live without - but realtime interaction? I communicate a lot through facebook messages.</p>

<p>Since Facebook exposes it&rsquo;s chat services through XMPP and social graph as a RESTful JSON service, you would think something could be done about this. But no, Facebook isn&rsquo;t willing to play this game because they don&rsquo;t want to lose users.</p>

<p>Which brings me back to the idea of Data Portability. Why can&rsquo;t I keep my own little corner of the social graph, and Facebook and Google just provide services on top of it? In spite of the technical difficulties this is not such a crazy idea - there are plenty of solutions for distributed data storage and aggregation.</p>

<p>Part of the necessary technology already exists in the Diaspora project. Diaspora is distributed, but it still requires servers. It isn&rsquo;t peer-to-peer in the way that we more usually associate with file sharing. You don&rsquo;t run a Diaspora application on your PC when you want to access it - you have to run a well-connected server all the time.</p>

<p>There are schemes which could overcome the always-connected architecture for distributing social graph data, but doing the same thing for realtime interaction is more difficult. Keeping track of my chat and realtime messaging activities when I have hundreds of friends is much easier when there is a single, co-ordinating hub. It becomes next to impossible when there is no server and I&rsquo;m using multiple clients on multiple devices.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s the challenge - can you keep distributed, continuously updated realtime data without some form of server infrastructure?</p>
