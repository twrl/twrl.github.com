			<p>Back in February, TrustWave hit the news with tales of selling intermediate CA certificates
for use in Man-in-the-Middle traffic interception. TrustWave were redeemed somewhat by
having already revoked the offending certificate before voluntarily disclosing what they
had done.</p>

<p>For most users, security hinges on SSL/TLS to provide an encrypted connection, and X.509
PKI to provide certificates all the way up to a small number of trusted roots. A large
number will be aware of the terms SSL and certificate from their web browser, but may
not understand what they mean or how they work.</p>

<p>The TrustWave incident has been a reminder of just how much trust we place in the root CAs.
In theory we have assurances in the form of CSPs and independent audits against those
policies. But it seems that WebTrust, who audit for TrustWave, were not aware of the 
offending intermediate CA certificate. TrustWave have implied strongly that they are not
the only ones to have sold intermediate certificates either. It&rsquo;s difficult to have faith
in the public key infrastructure under such circumstances.</p>

<p>But add to that, we have the looming 
<a href="http://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Communications_Data_Bill">Communications Data Bill</a>
which, amongst other unsavoury things, can be used to mandate Man-in-the-Middle attacks on
TLS sessions - and presumably similar interception of VPN, Tor and other encrypted traffic.
This brings the whole concept of centralised hierarchical trust, which underlies PKI, into 
question. We have no assurance that the entities at the top of the hierarchy are 
trustworthy - in fact, we have good reason to suspect that they may not be.</p>

<p>The alternative model to PKI is the Web of Trust. This is best known for it&rsquo;s use in PGP.
The main problem with the web of trust is accumulating sufficient endorsement for one&rsquo;s 
certificate to be trusted everywhere. This makes it very difficult to use web of trust for
infrastructure applications. </p>

<p>In 1992, when Phil Zimmermann first put forward the web of trust as the central concept for
PGP&rsquo;s key management, we didn&rsquo;t have social networks like we do now. The concept of a 
Friend-to-Friend network was very much a niche one. Average Joe user would not be carrying
around the necessary data, and would not know or have remote access to it, to create the
necessary links. Now however, in the day of home servers, smartphones, and web interfaces,
there is no reason why the web of trust should not be reinvigorated as part of the 
distributed social graph. </p>

<p>Another advantage of this is that it moves the trust policy decision back to the user. As
it stands, the majority of Firefox users trust whomever Mozilla have decided to trust, the
majority of IE users trust whomever Microsoft have decided to trust, and so on. 
Decentralising trust will allow users to make their own decisions about trust metrics,
transitivity, and so on. This entails some user education, but user interaction has come on
a long way in recent years and the concept of implicit and explicit trust shouldn&rsquo;t be too
difficult to grasp, even if the technical details are more tricky.</p>

<p>Like IPv6 migration, we will likely remain with the existing infrastructure until it 
becomes untenable. Personally, I am no longer comfortable with the centralised nature of 
it, but keeping PKI is better than giving up TLS. </p>
