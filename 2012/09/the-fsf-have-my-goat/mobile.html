			<p>I&rsquo;ve never made a secret of my mixed feelings about the FSF and what they do. </p>

<p>For anyone who isn&rsquo;t aware, the UEFI forum have devised a standard called
Secure Boot. Secure Boot requires the firmware to cryptographically verify
operating system images at load time, using public keys stored in NVRAM. The
standard doesn&rsquo;t require it explicitly, but in practice this means using the 
secure keystore and trusted boot path functions of a Trusted Platform Module.</p>

<p>Microsoft have stated that for hardware manufacturers to recieve Windows 8 logo
certification they must meet certain requirements regarding Secure Boot. Amongst
other things Secure Boot must be fully implemented the user must be able to 
disable Secure Boot on x86 and x86-64 based systems. Meaning that as well as the
UEFI mandated software API for disabling and overriding the behaviour of Secure
Boot, Microsoft have mandated that there must be a user interface. </p>

<p>The computer, and the vast majority of the world&rsquo;s computers are sold 
preinstalled with Microsoft Windows, must be able to verify that the core of the
operating system is untampered with at boot-time. And the user must be able to
disable this function. These requirements seem thoroughly reasonable, and 
address the spectre of UEFI and Hypervisor malwares.</p>

<p>So why does the front page of the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">FSF website</a> look like
this:</p>

<p><img style="width: 100%" src="/attachments/2012-09-26-fsf.org-screenshot.png" /></p>

<p>The only explanation I can think of is that the FSF are so invested in the idea
of every development being a Microsoft led conspiracy against freedom that they
can&rsquo;t not spin things like this any more. In fact, anyone who does comply with
Microsofts certification requirements has already met the demands stated in the
FSF petition.</p>

<p>There are plenty of very legitimate grievances against Microsoft, but this not 
one of them. For the time being, at least, Microsoft&rsquo;s policy seems quite 
reasonable and quite responsible. </p>

<p>Microsoft has the clout to get it&rsquo;s public keys included in practially every 
firmware, and the corporate world will have no compunction about getting their
certificates signed by Microsoft. Red Hat have announced their intention to do
just that for the Fedora Linux distribution. </p>

<p>But never in a million years will the FSF let Microsoft sign their certificates,
for ideological reasons. They have already condemned Red Hat for doing so.
The FSF&rsquo;s intentions may be pure, but they&rsquo;re politically very divisive. If the
whole Open Source and Free Software communities were to unite behind the FSF, 
then their keys could well be in every firmware just like Microsoft&rsquo;s. But that
will never happen.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to consider the role of the FSF, and whether they now do more harm 
than good for the movement that they once nurtured.</p>
