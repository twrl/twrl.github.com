For anyone who isn’t aware, the UEFI forum have devised a standard called
Secure Boot. Secure Boot requires the firmware to cryptographically verify
operating system images at load time, using public keys stored in NVRAM. The
standard doesn’t require it explicitly, but in practice this means using the 
secure keystore and trusted boot path functions of a Trusted Platform Module.

the pros and cons of the x86 processor. It’s not all bad.

It is impressive that software written for the 8086, which was released 35 years
ago, will still run without modification on the latest Intel i7 or AMD A-series.
But it’s also a burden, because as anyone who has ever tried to manipulate the
Global Descriptor Table will tell you, holding on to back-compatibility has
led to some hideously fragmented data structu</p></a></li>

turned to a very old friend - osdev.

When I was a teenager I dabbled in Operatng Systems quite a lot. I had some 
great vision of how a new operating system should be, but of course I lacked
both the patience and the knowledge to actually bring it about.

I’m somewhat older and wiser now, so maybe I’ll get a little further than 
printing “hello world”. At the moment, I’m just trying out some ideas in a very

this website. Believe me, that was difficult to achieve.

I’d investigated quite a few different Jekyll plugins, and when I couldn’t find
one to do what I wanted I investigated quite a few different approaches to
writing Jekyll plugins. But then I realised, I can do what I need far more
simply.

I’ve been thinking about the relationship between resources and their
representations. I wrote recently about the difference</p></a></li>

A resource need not have a digital representation, and the representation of a resource may also be a distinct resource in it’s own right. There is a whole gamut of issues about resources, possibly the best known is httpRange-14. 

A lot of these questions only become important when you start getting involved with Semantic Web technology. For example, is this properly described as a web page or as a blog post?
